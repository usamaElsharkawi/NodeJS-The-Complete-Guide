# Section 4: Improved Development Workflow and Debugging

> TypeScript (native `.ts`) running on Node.js v24+.
> Toolchain: `node app.ts` (type-stripping) + `tsc --noEmit` (type-checking)

## 🔧 Project Setup (run once)

```bash
# 1) scaffold (skip if present)
npm init -y
npm install -D typescript @types/node

# 2) use the provided tsconfig.json below (Node-native strict)

# 3) every lecture:  (a) type-check, then (b) run natively
npm run lint      # tsc --noEmit  (strict: erasableSyntaxOnly, verbatimModuleSyntax)
npm start         # node app.ts   (or: node --watch app.ts for auto-restart)
```

### tsconfig.json (native TypeScript strict, no emit)

```jsonc
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2023",
    "module": "NodeNext",
    "moduleResolution": "NodeNext",
    "lib": ["ES2023"],
    "noEmit": true, // tsc = type-check only; Node strips types at runtime
    "strict": true,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,
    "exactOptionalPropertyTypes": true,
    "erasableSyntaxOnly": true,   // 🔑 native-TS guard (blocks enums/const-enum/param props)
    "verbatimModuleSyntax": true, // 🔑 forces explicit `import type`
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "types": ["node"]
  },
  "include": ["*.ts"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

### package.json (scripts)

```json
{
  "name": "nodejs-complete-guide-section4",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node app.ts",
    "dev": "node --watch app.ts",
    "lint": "tsc --noEmit"
  }
}
```

# Lecture 42: Understanding NPM Scripts

## What I learned
- **NPM scripts** are command shortcuts stored in `package.json` under the `"scripts"` key.
  They let you avoid memorizing long terminal commands and keep project workflows consistent.
- **Running scripts:**
  - `npm run <script-name>` executes any named script.
  - `npm start` is a shortcut for `npm run start` (no `run` needed).
  - `npm test` is a shortcut for `npm run test`.
  - `npm run` (no script name) prints all available scripts.
- **Shell execution:** npm runs scripts inside a **shell** (`/bin/sh` on Unix, `cmd.exe` on Windows).
  This means shell features like pipes (`|`), redirection (`>`), and variable expansion work inside scripts.
- **PATH injection:** npm automatically prepends `node_modules/.bin` to the `PATH` for scripts.
  This is why you can run locally installed tools (e.g. `tsc`, `nodemon`) directly by name
  instead of `npx tsc` or `./node_modules/.bin/tsc`.
- **Lifecycle hooks:** npm supports **pre** and **post** hooks for every script:
  - `prestart` → `start` → `poststart`
  - `predev` → `dev` → `postdev`
  - `prelint` → `lint` → `postlint`
  These run automatically in order. A failing `pre` script prevents the main script from running.
- **Passing arguments:** use `--` to forward args to the underlying command:
  - `npm run start -- --port 4000` → Node receives `--port 4000`
  - `npm run lint -- --strict` → tsc receives `--strict`
- **Exit codes:** the script's exit code becomes npm's exit code. If the command exits with `0`,
  npm prints success; any non-zero code marks the script as **failed** (critical for CI).
- **Concurrency:** by default npm runs scripts **serially**. The `&` suffix runs a script in the
  background (e.g. `"watch": "tsc --watch &"`). npm v7+ also supports `npm-run-all` for parallel
  execution, but the course uses simple built-in syntax.

### The lifecycle flow

```text
  npm run dev
       │
       ▼
  ┌─────────────┐
  │  predev     │  (if defined)
  └──────┬──────┘
         ▼
  ┌─────────────┐
  │   dev       │  ← your main command
  └──────┬──────┘
         ▼
  ┌─────────────┐
  │  postdev    │  (if defined)
  └─────────────┘
```

- If `predev` fails, `dev` never runs and npm exits with the `predev` error code.
- Hooks are optional — omit them when you don't need pre/post steps.

## TypeScript mapping
- **Scripts are shell commands, not TypeScript.** The TS type system does not validate script values
  (they are plain strings in `package.json`).
- **The type-checking boundary:** `tsc --noEmit` runs *inside* an npm script but is a **separate
  process**. It reads `tsconfig.json`, type-checks your `.ts` files, and exits — it does not execute
  them. Node then runs the compiled (or in our case, type-stripped) code.
- **ESM + scripts:** `"type": "module"` in `package.json` affects Node's module resolution, not npm
  scripts themselves. The script `"node app.ts"` works identically whether `"type": "module"` is set
  or not — `node` decides ESM/CJS based on `package.json`, extension, and `--input-type`.
- **`import type` safety applies to source files, not scripts.** The TypeScript compiler enforces
  `verbatimModuleSyntax` and `erasableSyntaxOnly` in `.ts` files; `package.json` scripts remain
  free-form strings.
- **Native TS workflow:** because Node 24 strips types natively, our `start` script is simply
  `"node app.ts"`. No build step, no `tsc --outDir`, no `ts-node`. `tsc --noEmit` is a *separate*
  quality gate run via `"lint"`.

## Notes & gotchas
- **`npm start` ≠ `npm run start`** syntactically, but they are functionally identical for the
  `start` script only. For every other script name, you **must** use `npm run <name>`.
- **Scripts run from the project root.** `node app.ts` in a script resolves relative to `package.json`,
  not the terminal's current working directory.
- **`node_modules/.bin` is magic.** Tools installed locally (e.g. `typescript`, `nodemon`) are
  symlinked there. npm adds this folder to `PATH` automatically — so `tsc` works in scripts even
  though it's not a global install.
- **Don't commit `node_modules/`.** It is regenerated by `npm install` from `package.json` +
  `package-lock.json`. Our `.gitignore` excludes it.
- **`npm run` without arguments lists scripts** sorted alphabetically, with the `start` / `test`
  shortcuts flagged. Useful for onboarding.
- **`--` forwarding is easy to forget.** `npm run start --port 4000` does **not** work — npm eats
  `--port` as its own flag. You must write `npm run start -- --port 4000`.
- **Pre hooks are the right place for setup** (e.g. `prelint`: `tsc --noEmit` then `eslint .`),
  and post hooks for teardown/notification. Overusing them obscures the actual script purpose.
- **`npm run` inherits the current shell environment.** `PORT=3000 npm run start` sets `process.env.PORT`
  in Node — but this syntax is Unix-only. For cross-platform env vars, use `cross-env`:
  `"start": "cross-env PORT=3000 node app.ts"`.
- **`npm run` prints `> project@version <script-name>`** before the command output — purely cosmetic
  but helps identify which script produced which output in logs.
- **Scripts are NOT tasks.** npm has no built-in task runner features (parallel, conditional, etc.).
  For complex orchestration, use `npm-run-all`, `concurrently`, or a dedicated task runner.
  The course keeps it simple with sequential shell commands.
